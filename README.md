# Snake-Game-

**ðŸŒˆ Colorful Snake Game**
This project is a **vibrant and modern take on the classic Snake game**, built entirely using **Python and Pygame**. The snake shines in rainbow hues, slithering smoothly across a gradient background with colorful food and glowing effects â€” no dull reptiles here!

### **Features**

* **Rainbow Snake:** Each segment shines with a different bright color, cycling through the full rainbow.
* **Glowing Head & Eyes:** The snakeâ€™s head has a glowing highlight and cute eyes for extra charm.
* **Colorful Food:** Food appears as pulsing, multicolored circles chosen randomly from the rainbow palette.
* **Smooth Gameplay:** Continuous movement, wall-wrapping, and intuitive controls.
* **Game States:** Includes pausing, restarting, and a colorful game-over screen.
* **Pure Pygame:** No external libraries beyond Pygame required.

### **How It Works**

* **Snake Movement:**
  The snake moves across a grid, advancing one block at a time. When it eats food, it grows longer.
* **Wall Wrapping:**
  If the snake crosses one edge, it teleports seamlessly to the opposite side.
* **Collision Detection:**
  The game ends when the snake collides with itself.
* **Food Spawning:**
  Food spawns randomly, avoiding the snakeâ€™s body.
* **Visual Effects:**
  Each frame redraws the background gradient, rainbow segments, and glowing highlights for smooth animation.

### **Controls**

* **W / A / S / D** or **Arrow Keys** â†’ Move the snake
* **SPACE** â†’ Pause / Resume the game
* **Q** or **ESC** â†’ Quit
* **R** â†’ Restart after Game Over

### **File Structure**

```
Snake.py   # Main game file containing all logic and visuals
```

### **Customization**

* **Speed:** Adjust the frame rate (`self.clock.tick(8)`) to change difficulty.
* **Grid Size:** Change `GRID_SIZE` to make the snake larger or smaller.
* **Color Palette:** Modify `RAINBOW_COLORS` for custom color themes.
* **Window Dimensions:** Adjust `WINDOW_WIDTH` and `WINDOW_HEIGHT` for different screen sizes.
